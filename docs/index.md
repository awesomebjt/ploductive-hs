## Ploductive

Ploductive will be a To-Do list web application you can visit online, or
host yourself. It is written in Haskell's Yesod framework, and includes two
front ends: a web front end you can use in a browser, and a REST API that will
allow you to write your own client, or interact programmatically.

This page is sparse for now, but soon I'll have download links, build
instructions, and the occasional news and updates.
